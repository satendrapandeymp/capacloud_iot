IOT

In this project I had done coding for server side.
All We have to do is Setup this app and do some coding required to set up the microconroller and camera....
Also we have to replace localhost from server ip in camera.py, mqtt_s.py, index.html.

Aside from requirement.txt, You have to install opencv-python version>3.0 and a mqtt broker "Mosquitto".
write a conf file for mosquitto,place a websocket listner in conf.d folder.
